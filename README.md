<h1>DXT2</h1>

<p>Lightweight OS based on Debian 10, XFCE, Tint2, Pmenu</p>
<p>Along with many improvements over the defaults</p>

<p>I needed to replace Windows 7 and had just discovered Linux (6 years ago). I needed something light as I can't afford high-end hardware. Also easy to configure. So I began distro-hopping. I went through them all. Not just in VMs I installed to bare metal and used it for days to weeks to months. I ran into a million issues. I waded through tons of bad linux documentation and collected all the good bits along the way. I settled on XFCE. It was the "best" but it still wasn't nearly good enough. And the idea of DXT2 was born.</p>
