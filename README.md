<h1 style="color:#336699!important;">DXT2</h1>

<p>Lightweight OS based on Debian 10, XFCE, Tint2, Pmenu along with many improvements over the defaults.</p>

<p>I needed to replace Windows 7 and had just discovered Linux (6 years ago). I needed something light as I can't afford high-end hardware. Also easy to configure. So I began distro-hopping. I went through them all. Not just in VMs I installed to bare metal and used it for days to weeks to months. I ran into a million issues. I waded through tons of bad linux documentation and collected all the good bits along the way. I settled on XFCE. It was the "best" but it still wasn't nearly good enough. And the idea of DXT2 was born.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Completely modernises XFCE</li>
  <li>Tweaked for a better desktop experience</li>
  <li>Replaces your existing installation with very little input</li>
  <li>Built from netboot with only the required packages to run XFCE efficiently, nothing else</li>
  <li>Only 3 custom actions so as not to overcrowd YOUR menu (Open Root Terminal, Edit as Root, Convert to JPG)</li>
  <li>Removed all languages except English (you can still add your own easily)</li>
  <li>Shortened application names</li>
  <li>Reduced menu clutter</li>
  <li>Debian Buster</li>
</ul>

It's standard Debian and uses the standard Debian repos.
